# Naming convention

Here lies the default naming convention for JavaScript code. The guide may
define additional rules for specific contexts. To see more, find the **Naming
convention** sections of other categories.

## Variables

Variables should be in **camelCase**.

**ALL_CAPS** is allowed for constants, but the guide has no specific definition
of what is considered a constant.

!!!secondary Incomplete

## Functions and methods

Both functions and methods should be in **camelCase**.

## Classes

Classes should be in **PascalCase**.

## Statement labels

Statement labels should be in **camelCase**.
