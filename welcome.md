# The Lazy TypeScript Guidelines

**The Lazy TypeScript Guidelines** is a set of guidelines for writing code that
is easy to understand, easy to maintain, and at the same time minimizing the
amount of decisions you take while writing.

## Why minimize decisions?

Decisions are hard, sometimes take a lot of time, can lead to long discussions
in code reviews and can be a source of bugs.

This guide offers a set of decisions that you and your team can follow to focus
on what really matters, writing good code.

## How did this guide come to be?

This guide is the result of about a year of experience in front-end and Node.js
development. The author is very interested in TypeScript's type system, Node.js,
and React's data flow. One year is clearly not enough experience, so this guide
is a living document that will be updated as the author learns more.
